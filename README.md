# EX-01-Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## Aim:
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.
## Algorithm:
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.
## Program:
```
Developed by: KOMALAVARSHINI.S
Register Number: 212224230133
a=int(input())
if a%2==0:
    print(f"{a} is an Even number")
    if a>=25:
        print(f"{a} is greater than or equal to 25")
    else:
        print(f"{a} is lesser than 25")
else:
    print(f"{a} is NOT an Even number")
```

## Result:
Thus the program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements has been executed successfully.

# EX-02-Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## Aim:
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## Algorithm:
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## Program:
``` 
Developed by:KOMALAVARSHINI.S
Register Number:212224230133
a = (0 == True)

b = (False== False)

c = True + True

d = False + 9

print(f"a is",a)
print(f"b is",b)
print(f"c:",c)
print(f"d:",d)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` has been executed successfully.

# EX-03-Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## Aim:
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## Algorithm:
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## Program:
```
Developed by: KOMALAVARSHINI.S
Register Number:212224230133
a=eval(input())
print(type(a))
```
## Output:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e1f99ad-8c50-43f3-a5e6-df17558a8058)

## Result:
Thus the program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals has been executed successfully.

# EX-04-Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## Aim:
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## Algorithm:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## Program:
```
Developed by:KOMALAVARSHINI.S
Register Number: 212224230133
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=complex (a,b)
print(c)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts has been executed successfully.

# EX-05-Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## Aim:
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm:
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## Program:
```
Developed by: KOMALAVARSHINI.S
Register Number: 212224230133
men_stepped_on_the_moon=12
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to read a string from the user and then print ithas been executed successfully.
